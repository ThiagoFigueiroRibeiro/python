Solving some problems with Python

0001 - Triangle Test: Given 3 sides of a triangle, let's test if it exists and if it is Scalene, Isoceles or Equilateral.

0002 - Months: Very simple program where you input the number of the month you want and it returns which month it is. For instance, you put '7' and it returns 'The month 7 is July'. It handles ValueError exceptions if you try being funny with your inputs. 

0003 - Fizz Buzz: One solution for the Fizz Buzz Problem. If you try anything other than integers as inputs, it raises exceptions and finish the program.

0004 - Turtle Race: Currently learning Turtle (https://realpython.com/beginners-guide-python-turtle/). The idea is making a race where 2 turtles try finishing first. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

0005 - Soccer Field: This is a python script to be used with Blender 3d. It makes a soccer field of Width x Length with all the white lines. I made this years ago when working selling synthetic sports turf for our clients to see the dimensions of their project. To use this, you must first install Blender 3D, then put this on the "Scripting" tab then run it with "Alt + P".
