Solving some problems with Python

0001 - Triangle Test: Given 3 sides of a triangle, let's test if it exists and if it is Scalene, Isoceles or Equilateral.

0002 - Months: Very simple program where you input the number of the month you want and it returns which month it is. For instance, you put '7' and it returns 'The month 7 is July'. It handles ValueError exceptions if you try being funny with your inputs. 

0003 - Fizz Buzz: One solution for the Fizz Buzz Problem. If you try anything other than integers as inputs, it raises exceptions and finish the program.

0004 - Turtle Race: Currently learning Turtle (https://realpython.com/beginners-guide-python-turtle/). The idea is making a race where 2 turtles try finishing first. (WORK IN PROGRESS)
